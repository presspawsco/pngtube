**PNGTube** is a PNGTuber software built in Godot, which is primarily designed for users that don't need heavy customization and would prefer ease of use.

## Installation
Currently there is no way to use PNGTube unless you run it through the Godot Engine. PNGTube is on **4.2.2-stable**[^1] and there are intentions of updating to 4.3 in the future. The first release build will likely drop in the near future.
